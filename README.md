# Boardoza Excelitas TPiS 1S 1385 High-Sensitivity Presence Sensor Breakout Board

The **Boardoza Excelitas TPiS 1S 1385** is a compact and ultra-low-power **infrared presence and motion detection breakout board** based on the **Excelitas TPiS 1S 1385** thermopile sensor. Designed for **non-contact presence sensing**, this module integrates a high-sensitivity thermopile with a **120° field of view**, ideal for motion-triggered lighting, smart occupancy detection, and thermal monitoring in energy-efficient IoT systems.

It features an **I²C interface** (default address: 0x0C), integrated digital signal processing, and a dedicated **interrupt pin** for presence, movement, and temperature threshold events. With just **15µA of typical current draw**, the TPiS 1S 1385 is an ideal solution for battery-powered and energy-sensitive applications.
